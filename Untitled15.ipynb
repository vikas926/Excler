Mr. Goud's ESR is elevated (26 mm/hr in the first hour, 52 mm/hr in the second), suggesting the presence of inflammation.\n",

            "* **Platelet Count:** Counts the number of platelets (involved in blood clotting).  His count (2.0 lakhs/cumm) is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Packed Cell Volume (PCV):** The percentage of red blood cells in the blood. His level (40.5%) is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Differential Count:** Shows the percentage of different types of white blood cells. All values are within normal limits.\n",

Other tests are generally within normal limits, ruling out malaria and dengue fever and showing normal liver and kidney function.  However, the slightly low sodium level and the positive, though not definitive, Widal test warrant further investigation by Dr. Krishna Prasad to determine the cause of the inflammation and potential typhoid infection.  This explanation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.  He needs to discuss these results with his doctor.\n",
